//Explanation
// AppRouter is like a navigation guide that decides where to send the user 
//when they ask to go to a specific page.

// When the user asks to go to the root page ('/'), the guide sends them to the SplashPage.

// If they try to go to a room that doesnâ€™t exist, the guide sends them to an error 
//page that says "Invalid Route."
